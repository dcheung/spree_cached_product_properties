Cached Product Properties
============================

Provides a simple wrapper around Prodcuct Properties that allows them to be cached.
Properties are deleted from the cache on touching the product.

Installation
------------

Add `spree_cached_product_properties` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_cached_product_properties'
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
